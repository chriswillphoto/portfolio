        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Raised on the mean streets of a cushy, middle-class, north shore suburb,
          I draw on a wide and varied life to bring perspective and passion to everything I work on.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started to learn to code out of curiosity and quickly found that it utilised two of my favourite things: problem solving and creative thinking.
          The simple act of writing my first web page had me hooked and fiending for more.  I found it was something I could
          definitely do all day, every day, which led me to learning web development at General Assembly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I live a life filled with doing random things for shits and giggles, because no one ever found growth by sitting
          inside their comfort zone. I tend to throw myself face first into things, like an experiential crash test dummy,
          just to see how things shake out.
        </p>
        <p>This is just a first draft and 'selling yourself' feels dirty. Stop Judging Me.</p>
